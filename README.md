    This program checks the strength of a user input password based on several qualities: length, contents, consecutive characters, and common passwords. It then gives the password a rating from 0 (weak) to 10 (strong).

    This program can be run by pressing the run button at the top of the code and then inputting a password below the code. This program is dependent on Java's Regex and Scanner classes. 
 
    Clear warnings about its limitations (e.g., “This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information” - this will vary depending on your program)

    This tool is for educational use only. It does not save, share, or track the user inputs. 

    Because this tool does not store any user data, there are not many ways to abuse the tool. The password checker is ethical under utilitarianism because it provides a good service for the majority of people. 
    However, if someone were to watch another user input their test password, they could then gain access to their accounts. The tool could also lead people to believe that if they find one great password they can
    then use that password for everything. This would then make that password a weak password.
